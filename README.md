# What is Trish?
Trish, the name, is an intelligently put together acronym that stands for "The rogue-like idea some had." It is a small community project maintained by members of the One Lone Coder Discord server (https://discordapp.com/invite/7tjEznK) aimed at creating an ASCII rogue-like. 

# Setting (Work in Progress)
Set in a futuristic jazzy setting akin to the 1920's, you are a detective investigating an interstellar mafia's headquarters.

# Building for Windows
Trish uses premake to automatically generate the project structure, particularly for Visual Studio 2017. To initialise the solution, run build.bat and wait for it to create the necessary components. You should be able to open the solution file and begin compiling.
